# LeakSanitizer suppressions file
# This file can be used to suppress known false positives or third-party library leaks
# 
# Format:
# leak:<function_name_pattern>
# 
# Examples:
# leak:__libc_dlopen_mode
# leak:_dl_allocate_tls
# 
# Add suppressions here as needed for legitimate cases where leaks
# cannot be fixed (e.g., in third-party libraries or system libraries)
